## **Fri**, a digital product craftsman

I define a _digital product craftsman_ as a person who makes _useful_ digital products such as websites, apps, and alike. To accomplish it, this person will _mindfully_ and _pragmatically_ use their _research_, _design_, _development_, _business_, _teamwork_, and _communication_ skills to:

- _understand_ the product's users, their context, and their goals,
- conduct _experiments_ to find a satifying solution,
- ensure the solution is _sustainable_, and
- _learn_ as much as possible!

[For the past 10+ years](#notable-timeline), I tried my best to be one and plan to keep being one for years to come!

On the side, I also cycle, play tennis, and [dive](/divelogs) for fun. :-)
