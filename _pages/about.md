# <img src='/assets/icons/about.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;<span class='jump-effect'>**Fri**</span>, a problem solver

<big>I do
<img src='/assets/icons/research.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_research_,
<img src='/assets/icons/design.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_design_,
<img src='/assets/icons/code.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_develop_,
<img src='/assets/icons/test.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_test_,
<img src='/assets/icons/track.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_track_, and
<img src='/assets/icons/lead.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_lead_ utilizing an
<img src='/assets/icons/iterative.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_iterative_
and <img src='/assets/icons/human-centric.svg' alt='' class="icon"/>&nbsp;_human
centric_ approach.</big>

Whilst my main trade is in Design and Product Management, I see myself as a
_problem solver_. And to make sure that the solution is working, I am eager to
learn and do what's necessary. Just like Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt said in their
book:

> “If you’re a Pragmatic Programmer, you’ll share many of the following
> characteristics:
>
> **Jack of all trades:** … Although your current job may require you to be a
> specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas and new
> challenges.”

> Thomas & Andrew Hunt</span>

And I see myself not as a _Pragmatic Programmer_, but as a __pragmatic problem_
solver_.
