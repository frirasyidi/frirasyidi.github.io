# About Fri

I am Fri; designer with well-designed name to remember.

As a product designer, I use *common sense* and *user centric approach* to design products and services that are **useful** and valuable for people like you, me, and everyone else. With 5 years of experience in digital design and business understadning from my business management undergraduate study, I’ve helped private businesses, NGOs, and the government to design their products.

I am currently working as UX UI Designer and Acting Product Manager of Growth team for [HappyFresh][HappyFresh]. I also writes about user experience, design, and startups at [http://frirasyidi.com][Fri Rasyidi].

Aside of my career as a designer, I have two years of experience in connecting people and sparks collaboration from being a business and community manager as the Chief of the first coworking space in Jakarta.

I also cycle, hike, and [dive](/divelogs) for fun! :-)
