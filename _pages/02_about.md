# About Me

My name is Fri; the easiest name to remember.

I work as a designer whose primary goal is to make products and services <strong>useful</strong> for people like you, me, and everyone else by using <em>common sense</em> and <em>user centric approach</em>.</p>

I am currently working as UX UI Designer for [HappyFresh][HappyFresh] and writes about user experience, design, and startups at [http://frirasyidi.com][Fri Rasyidi].

With 5 years of experience in digital design and business and management understanding from my undergraduate study, I've helped private businesses, NGOs, and the government designed their products.

Aside from being a designer, I have two years of experience being a business and community manager as the Chief of the first coworking space in Jakarta.

I also cycle, hike, and [dive](/divelogs) for fun! :-)
