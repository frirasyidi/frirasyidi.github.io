# This is the data for my site

This is the source of my site running on http://frirasyidi.com. The site is using [Jekyll](http://jekyll) to automatically stitch the data into a static site on GitHub Pages.

## Running in local

1. **Install Jekyll**, make sure it is properly installed on your machine. Check [Jekyll documentation for installation steps](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. **Run Jekyll using Bundler**, go to the repository directory and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from your Terminal; this will serve your Jekyll site locally.
3. **Access it via [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)** from your browser.
