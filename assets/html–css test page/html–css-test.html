    <article id="blockElements">
      <h2>Basic block elements.</h2>
      <p>This is how a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element) look. This page was primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for various other purposes as well, like just checking how your browser displays various HTML elements by default. It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>

      <p>In this other paragraph, I would like to shout out to <a href="https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/personal.html">Jukka Korpela</a> who writes the <a href="https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www/testel.html">original test document</a> in which this document is based on. I decided to rewrite the document to cover the needs of HTML5 semantics and structure which is not yet covered&mdash;at least according to my personal needs.</p>

      <p>Unlike other parts that wrapped in <code>section</code> element, this Basic block elements part is wrapped in <code>article</code> for testing purpose. Article is a self-contained, standalone section of an HTML document in which its content should make sense on its own and should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site (e.g. blog post).</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>This is a block quotation containing a single paragraph. Well, not quite, since this is not <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you understand the point. After all, this page does not use HTML markup very normally anyway.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The above blockquote doesn't have <code>cite</code> attribute since it's not directly quoted from a site. For accessibility reason, in case that you're quoting from a site, you should add <code>cite</code> attribute and a link directing to it. A sample of <code>blockquote</code> with <code>cite</code> attribute can be found below where I quoted a paragraph from W3C wiki:</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Marking_up_textual_content_in_HTML">
        <p>If the quote comes from another web page, you can indicate this using the <code>cite</code> attribute ... The cite attribute is not required in a case where the quote is taken from a novel, magazine or other form of offline content.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The following is preformatted text. Preformatted text is defined with <code>pre</code> and is an unusual HTML tags that takes notice of every character in it (as illustration, other elements will ignore a consecutive space or a line-break). It is most commonly used for blocks of code, where spacing, such as indentations, can be relevant.</p>

      <pre>
        This     tag     will     render
      the     consecutive     spaces,
    the     indents,     and
  all     the     line-breaks
    exactly     as     how
      it     is     written
        in     the     HTML     doc.
      </pre>

      <p>Another basic block element that's worth mentioning is <code>address</code>. <code>address</code> element should only used to specifies contact informations of the entire web page, or or to an article element. Hence, it usually only used once and placed at the top or bottom of the document. Check <a href="#footer">the footer section of this document</a> to see how it looks.</p>

    <section id="textLevelMarkups">
      <h2>Text-level markups</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>; this is a sample of <code>abbr</code>, a tag that you use for abbreviation, a shortened form of a word or phrase. Keep in mind that <code>accronym</code> element is not supported in HTML5 and you should use <code>abbr</code> instead.</li>

        <li><em>See this</em>; this is a sample of <code>em</code>, a tag that you use to stress a word or phrase in a sentence.</li>

        <li><strong>Attention here</strong>; this is a sample of <code>strong</code>, a tag that you use to highlight part of a sentence that matters most, a warning, or something the user should act on quickly, etc.</li>

        <li><q lang="en"><mark>HTML5</mark> is the thing!</q>; this is a sample of <code>mark</code> inside of a quotation, a tag that you use to highlight a word or phrase that the original source/author did not intend to emphasize.</li>

        <li><i lang="id">Lihat sini</i>; this is a sample of <code>i</code>, a tag that you use to italic a word or phrase that is not for emphasizing, but only to visually present text of different quality. This tag is usually used for foreign words or latin names.</li>

        <li><b>Unimportant bold</b>; this is a sample of <code>b</code>, a tag that you use to bold a word or phrase that is not for emphasizing, but only to visually present text of different quality. This tag is almost unneeded but part of HTML5 spec nonetheless.</li>

        <li>q</li>

    <section id="lists">
      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <p>This is a paragraph before an <strong>unnumbered</strong> list: (<code>ul</code>). Note that
      the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard
      to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are
      logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>
      <ul>
        <li> One.
        </li><li> Two.
        </li><li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that
      for short items lists look better if they are compactly presented,
             whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
        </li><li> Four. This is the last item in this list.
             Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
      </li></ul>
      <p>The following is a <code>menu</code> list:</p>
      <menu>
        <li> One.
        </li><li> Two.
        </li><li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will
      probably wrap to the next line in rendering.
      </li></menu>
      <p>The following is a <code>dir</code> list:</p>
      <dir>
        <li> One.
        </li><li> Two.
        </li><li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will
      probably wrap to the next line in rendering.
      </li></dir>

      <p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>numbered</strong> list (<code>ol</code>). Note that
      the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard
      to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are
      logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>
      <ol>
        <li> One.
        </li><li> Two.
        </li><li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that if
      items are short, lists look better if they are compactly presented,
             whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
        </li><li> Four. This is the last item in this list.
             Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
      </li></ol>

      <p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>definition</strong> list (<code>dl</code>).
      In principle, such a list should consist of <em>terms</em> and associated
      definitions. But many authors use <code>dl</code> elements for fancy "layout" things. Usually the
      effect is not <em>too</em> bad, if you design user style sheet rules for <code>dl</code>
      which are suitable for real definition lists.</p>
