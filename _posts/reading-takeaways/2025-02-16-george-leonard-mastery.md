Last year, my previous co-founder read a book and told me that this book
describes me. She told me that I need to read the book, so I did. This is my
takeaways from the book.

_Note: This is my takeaways, not a summary. This means, it's not a one-to-one
comparison to the book. I have rephrased the contents and added some related concepts/knowledges. My goal here is
to help other learners in understanding the informations provided in the book.

## Overview

Life is a pursuit to mastery. A pursuit of mastery is not about the goal or
destination, but a process, a journey. The best move towards mastery is by
practicing diligently: “_practice for the sake of the practice itself_”.

Practicing for the sake of the practice itself is what the Japanese call “_Do_”,
The Path. It is the path which you travel upon towards mastery. Such path never
ends:

> _Do not think that_\
> _This is all there is._\
> _More and more_\
> _Wonderful teachings exist—_\
> _The sword is unfathomable._
>
> _— Yamaoka Tesshu, a great swordmaster._

## The archetypes

There are four archetypes when pursuing mastery:

- **The Dabbler**—loves to learn something new, but once the novelty is gone,
  feels there is nothing left to learn and will move from one thing to another.
- **The Obsessive**—puts maximum effort into learning and upon reaching a
  plateau, will put even more effort and get burned out.
- **The Hacker**—finds the quickest way simply to be good enough and has no
  intention of delving deeper into the practice.
- **The Master**—loves the practice and patience with the plateau.

Be aware that we have all the archetypes in ourselves. They are different
depending on our relationship with the subject.

## The keys to mastery

The 5 keys to mastery are as follows: (1) Instruction, (2) Practice, (3)
Surrender, (4) Intentionality, (5) The Edge.

### Instruction

Instructions help provide directions, but you need to be careful on who you get
it from. A credible source of instruction can lead you far; but otherwise can be
harmful. Instructions can prevent you from reinventing the wheel; but may also
give you the same blindspot that a self-taught person may explore.

A good instructor should be patient. Their students can be slow in some parts
and gifted with others. To help the student develop the love of doing the
practice and patience in the plateau, the instructor must be able to be
empathetic, being equal in reinforcing positive progress and correcting
mistakes.

Good learning materials are those that encourage active participation from the
student. When the student is eager to learn, they will absorb the material
better (see [intentionality](#intentionality)). Great instructors will make
materials that encourage such active participation.

A good student must be respectful and open minded. A Zen monk Sunryu Suzuki said
that “_when you learn too easily, you are tempted not to work hard, not to
penetrate the marrow of a practice._” The key is to work diligently despite your
talent.

### Practice

Practice is not something you _do_ but something you _have_. It is not a task,
but part of your life. The masters don’t devote themselves to their skill just
to get better at it. It is the love of the practice that will lead one to get
better. The more they enjoy the work, the better they get.

_There is a saying that I personally love that relates to this: “_Those who know
will lose to those who understand, those who understand will lose to those who
embody_.”_

Larry Bird, a Celtic basketball player, is one example of the practice.
[He practices every night](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxqZXL621iJCdEuY09hayAJDnVP_nmRa2I?si=o4qGRzWkn0O9tYB8)
because he loves it.

### Surrender

_The courage of a master is measured by his or her willingness to surrender._
This means surrendering to the teachings, the practice, the demands from your
student, and even to surrender an owned proficiency to relearn it and reach a
higher level.

### Intentionality {#intentionality}

Intentionality means you put mental thoughts, intention, when doing a certain
practice. A strongly intentioned practice has more impacts than 10 practices
without intent. When you practice intentionally, you start to notice every
little thing which helps you do deeper learning. Noticing is a way to discern,
and discerning is a sign of mastery.

Visioning what you’d like to accomplish also helps your body move towards the
goal as well as boost your motivation to achieve it.

There’s a study about
[viseo-motor behavior rehearsal (VMBR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe9NyHTfK14)
that shows how mental image helps in reaching mastery. The study invites 32
students to learn karate and divide them into 4 groups: (1) does deep muscle
relaxation only, (2) does imaging karate moves only, (3) does both (VMBR), (4)
does nothing. The third group excels.

### (Flirting with) the Edge

_The book called this key only as “The Edge”; I changed it to “Flirting with the
edge” to make it easier to understand what it means._

Those who seek mastery enjoys staying in as well as pushing the boundaries of
the practice itself. They practice to the fullest and challenge the limits
previously known, taking risks to gain higher performance. This is what helps
the master move inch-by-inch away from the plateau.

Julie Moss was in the first place during the 1982 Ironman. The second place is
20 minutes behind her. Just before the finish line, her body decided that it can
no longer do it, she fell to the ground. She gets herself up but keeps falling,
again, and again. But she persisted and
[crawled to the finish line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVKqFAPdjIA). The
BBC says it’s “heroic”, but the orthopedic surgeon says it’s “stupid—nearly
fatal”.

## How to…

### Keep your resolution {#keep-your-resolution}

After having a resolution, it’s normal for you to end up going back to how it
was. This is just a normal way of how the body naturally regulates
(homeostasis); it returns to the least effortful state.

This is how you can combat it:

- _Be aware that there is a natural tendency to go back to how it was
  (homeostasis)._ Not only the push comes from yourself, but also from your
  surroundings like friends and family. It’s not out of bad intention, it's just
  because it’s the most familiar state, the default one.
- _Be willing to negotiate with your resistance to change_. Sometimes, the
  changes that you try to make are just too much. Pushing yourself is good, but
  too much of it can have detrimental effects. You need to understand when to
  take a step back if you took two steps ahead.
- _Develop a support system_. Doing it together makes it easier. We are a social
  creature after all, so the feeling of a part of a group helps negate the
  homeostasis effect.
- _Follow a regular practice_. Making it regular will shift your default
  behavior, making it easier to keep your resolution.
- _Dedicated to lifelong learning_. Keep in mind that it’s a process, you may
  get setbacks, but that does not mean it’s ended.

### Get the energy {#get-the-energy}

We are actually balls of energy, that we regulate ourselves decide the amount of
energy that we can spend towards our practice.

- _Maintain physical fitness_. Helps you maintain the energy level. The less
  your body is used, the lower energy it has. Exercise also
  [conditions your ability in facing high stress situations](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax).
- _Be upfront and truthful_. We spend a lot of energy being inefficient by
  skirting our way around to avoid conflict.
- _Acknowledge the negative_. It is normal to have negative thoughts. When this
  happens, you need to acknowledge it rather than suppress it. Suppressing
  negative thoughts consumes a lot of energy.
- _Be positive_. Positive thoughts make you feel good and produce energy. Not to
  mention [visioning a positive outcome](#intentionality) itself is the key
  towards mastery.
- _Set your priorities, commit, and take action_. We are living in an age where
  we have multiple options available to us. By setting priorities, we allocate
  most of our energy on what matters most rather than spreading it around. The
  stronger our commitment to the priority, the more likely we are to take action
  and energy to do it.
- _Make a habit out of your practice._ When the practice becomes a habit, it
  requires less energy to do since it requires less cognitive effort. Since
  energy can move from high to low from time to time, making a practice a habit
  allows you to operate even on the lower side of the energy.

_The last two points remind me of
[BJ Fogg’s Behaviour Model](https://behaviormodel.org/) which describes a
threshold of how likely you do something based on how large is the motivation
and how much effort needed to do the task:_

- _The higher the motivation (set priority, visioning positive outcome), the
  more likely you are to do the practice._
- _The lower the effort (make habit, maintain physical fitness, minimum negative
  thoughts), the likelier you are to do the practice._

_Mel Robbins in her book The 5 second rule also affirms that taking action is
very important. When you lack the energy or motivation to do something
(procrastinate), do the task for 5 seconds (take action), and you’ll see that
you gain the energy to do the practice._

### Stay in the path

There are a lot of pitfalls along the path:

- conflicting or inconducive way of life,
- poor instruction,
- laziness,
- obsessive goal orientation,
- over- or lack of competitiveness,
- seeking prizes, medals, or vanities,
- drugs or shortcuts,
- dead seriousness,
- injuries or burn out,
- inconsistency, and
- perfectionism.

You can solve them by doing so:

- _Be realistic_. Life is full of things to do, obligations, pleasures,
  relationships. Don’t be overly obsessive with the path, negotiate it with your
  life, [make priority](#get-the-energy), and
  [get support from others](#keep-your-resolution).
- _Be consistent_. The same place, the same time, the same rhythm, will carry
  you through the practice. Consistency helps build a sense of familiarity which
  will help you focus on the task at hand—this is what we call “in the flow”.
- _Be modest_. Be ambitious but don’t be obsessed with the goal. Remember that
  it is a journey and not the end that matters. Even when you’ve reached the
  peak, keep on climbing.
- _Lighten up_. Taking it too seriously will give you tunnel vision. Failures
  and set backs will be very stressful when you’re overly serious. A sense of
  humor will help you see the bigger picture and improve your resiliency. The
  same goes to perfectionism, remember that it’s not the result that matters,
  but the process.
- _Be aware of yourself_. Resting and healing is part of the process. A fresh
  and good physical and mental stage will help you to progress far more than a
  burned out and injured one.
- _Get good instruction_. Surrender to your teacher and stick with it. Be
  critical, don’t just follow the momentum. Remember that not all teachers and
  teachings are good, but don’t judge too quickly.
- _Seek rivals and measure yourself_. A good competition goes a long way to
  boost your motivation. It helps you understand where you are, what you’re
  already good at and what you lack. But beware of being overcompetitive,
  winning is not everything. You need to enjoy the process and winning as well
  as losing is part of the journey.
- _Do_. Laziness will knock you off the path.
  [Be courageous and take action](#get-the-energy).
- _Be patient_. Don’t take shortcuts to progress quickly, “_slow and steady wins
  the race_”.
- _Motivate internally_. External motivation such as prizes, medals, vanity, and
  good images, can boost up your performance—but not in the long run. Once it’s
  no longer available, you will lose the motivation to do the practice. Internal
  motivation can always be renewed and its availability is within your control.

### View life’s mundane routines

A huge part of our lives is composed of routine tasks that seem insignificant,
such as washing clothes, cleaning houses, and commuting to work. If we’re
thinking of living in a goal oriented way in which accomplishing the goal is
only what matters, the other practices are going to only insignificant
“in-betweens”. Looking at our daily lives, does that mean that the majority of
our lives are insignificant?

There is another way of thinking about those “insignificant” activities: by
making them part of the practice. Zen practitioners are judged by how well they
sweep the yard as well as how well they meditated. This way, nothing in life is
“in-between”.

We can be [intentional](#intentionality), deliberate in doing our routines and
orient them towards our practices. For example: cleaning the house can be part
of a meditative process; commuting can be used as the time to read or and
visioning our practice.

You can also make each routine as a practice towards mastery in itself. For
example, when driving you can put your mind fully present to the activity, think
of how you turn on the car and get yourself seated, how you drive, which lane to
take, anticipating how other cars move, seeking improvements to make your
commute easier and more pleasant.

Both the above can be applied to mundane tasks like cleaning the house, driving
a car, to even your relationship.

### Exercise mind and body

_This section aligns with Chapter 14: Packing for the Journey which contains a
detailed instruction on the activities you can do. I will not repeat the
instructions here, but just the general understanding._

You can condition your mind and body through Leonard Energy Training (LET). It
uses the body as a metaphor to deal with problems in daily life whether it’s
physical, mental, or emotional. Since there is a connection between the physical
and mental state, you can center your mental state by proxy of your body.

- _Balancing and centering_. First you need to know where your center is. Once
  you’re centered, notice the change of your outlook to your surroundings.\
  — The exercise of this involves breathing and relaxing and loosening tight
  areas on the body to a neutral position.
- _Returning to the center_. Sometimes, life can put you in a disoriented
  situation. That is why you need to know how to recenter yourself.\
  — The exercise of this involves deliberately disorienting the body (such as by
  spinning), identifying non-centered areas of the body, and correcting it to
  the centered position.
- _Generating energy from unexpected blows_. Life sometimes gives you lemon, and
  you can use that lemon as a source of energy instead of being the victim of
  it.\
  — The exercise involves disruption to the body by a practice partner, noticing
  the energy shift, and using the excess energy to another form of activity.
- _Generating energy from your center_. The Japanese called it _ki_, Chinese
  _ch’i_, and _pneuma_ in Greek. This energy comes from your breathing and
  visualization of the power from your center of gravity. Notice that this
  energy is within you and all around you. You can tap it by visualizing it
  coming from your center, growing alongside your breathing and traveling
  outwards.\
  — The exercise involves two different approaches from sitting down to standing
  up while being resisted by a practice partner: (1) by focusing on the
  resistance and force against it using muscle power and (2) by focusing on
  breathing at the center of gravity and using it to stand up.
- _Power comes from relaxation_. Relaxation is essential for the full expression
  of power. Being tense and rigid actually diminishes your capability to exert
  power. An earthquake-proof building is the one that can flex along the
  shockwave, a rigid one will easily crumble.\
  — The exercise of this involves two acts to resist bending of arms by a
  practice partner: (1) by tightening the arm muscle to gain strength and (2) by
  relaxing the arm and thinking of it as a single unified part of a beam.

## Be willing to be a fool.

Learning can only take place when you allow yourself to fail, to make space for
something that will make you look stupid because of your lack of skill.

Think of the occurrences where you stop your learning because somebody else
thinks you cannot do it. When your family, friends, school, society did not
allow you to be playful, free, and foolish in the learning process.

This is the reason why kids often learn faster than adults. They are not worried
about looking incompetent. Abraham Maslow discovered this childlike quality in
people who excel at learning and called it “second naivete”.

Take this example from the founder of judo, Jigoro Kano, who upon his death,
wished to be buried in his white belt. A true master thinking of himself as a
beginner, _eager for knowledge, willing to play the fool_.
