Encountering error messages is a bad experience for your users. Since we always think about how to give the best user experience, with perfection in mind, we tend to overlook errors. But shit (errors) happens. So how do you make a good experience from bad experience?

When encountering errors your users are on the verge of leaving your service. But hey, see the opportunity there? They’re only on the verge of it. Which means, if you’re able to help them address the error, they might stay. Hell, if you give good experience, they might even love you for it. You know, they might think hey, I don’t care if there’s error, this app will help me through with it. No problem.

Clearly communicate the error
The most frustrating experience for users when they encounter error messages is when they don’t know what causes the errors. The one thing that you need to keep in mind is understandability of the message. Never use jargon. You know how irritated you are when you encounter smart asses who used hard jargons to show off? Yes, that’s how you sound like when you use jargons in your error messages. It’s even more irritating for your users in error messages since they’re actually in a frustrated state.

Be helpful
The second most frustrating experience for users when they encounter error messages is when they don’t know what to do to fix it. Especially when they keep encountering the problem.

Admit, and own it.

Humour
Being humorous can help, but be careful with it. It can definitely backfired. I always tend to move away from this. If you’re not confident with your copywriting skill, and don’t have full understanding on the context of the errors, try to refrain from humouring on the errors.
