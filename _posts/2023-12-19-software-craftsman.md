I define a _software craftsman_ as a person who makes _useful_ softwares such as
websites, apps, and alike. To accomplish it, this person will _mindfully_ and
_pragmatically_ use their _research_, _design_, _development_, _business_,
_teamwork_, and _communication_ skills to:

- _understand_ the product's users, their context, and their goals,
- conduct _experiments_ to find a satisfying solution,
- ensure the solution is _sustainable_, and
- _learn_ as much as possible!

[For the past 10+ years](#notable-timeline), I tried my best to be one and plan
to keep being one for years to come!

Aside from proficiency in product management and design, I also have:

- eagerness to develop people's capability and capacity,
- proficiency in test automation using Robot Framework or Cypress,
- junior-level web development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Python,
  and
- familiarity using Mac, Linux, Git and AWS.

On the side, I also cycle, play tennis, and dive for fun. :-)
