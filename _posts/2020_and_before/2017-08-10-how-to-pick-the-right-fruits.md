For the past year, I've been working in HappyFresh&mdash;a groceries delivery
startup. Last week, I was trusted by my friends to pick the best fruits but I
have no idea how to do it.

This post is my attempt to catalog the key to get the best fruits. Keep in mind
that this would be a growing list.

Sorted alphabetically:

## Apple

- **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no bruising, soft spots or
  cracks.
- **Firm**; avoid taking apples that are soft, discolored, or easily indented
  when lightly pressed.
- **Shiny red or yellowish color**; most of the time, get the most red you can
  find. Find green and yellow for Granny Smith and Golden delicious apples.
- **Pleasant aroma**; smell the apple. A good and fresh apple should have a
  pleasant aroma.

## Banana

- **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no sunken moist-looking
  dark areas, have their stem ends and skins intact, and not dull.
- **Bright in color**; choose those mostly yellow with a small amount of green
  at both ends.
- **Brown spots** for immediate consumption; the fullest flavor is derived from
  bananas that begin to develop tiny dark specks, known as sugar specks.
- **Full and plump**; depressed, moist, and dark areas on the skin usually
  signal the fruit inside is bruised.

## Melon

- **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no bruising, soft spots or
  cracks.
- **Smell sweet**; good melons should smell sweet and fragrant on the part where
  the vine is attached.
- **Dull skin**; a ripe melon has shiny skins with a green or white color.
  Always choose the yellowish dull colored melons.
- **Heavy for its size**; pick up a handful of melons, and if you find one that
  feels relatively heavy for its size, pick that one.

## Orange

- **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no bruising or soft spots.
- **Heavy for its size**; heavier oranges are juicier. Pick up a handful of
  oranges and find one that feels relatively heavy for its size.
- **Smell citrusy**; a quick sniff of the stem area at the top. It should smell
  like orange peel.
- **Firm smooth skin**; hold it in your hand and check if it feels firm and
  smooth.

## Watermelon

- **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no bruising, soft spots or
  cracks.
- **Sounds hollow**; tap the watermelon. If it sounds hollow, that means your
  watermelon is ripe, watery, and sweet.
- **Yellowish bottom**; the bottom part of your watermelon, the opposite part
  from the vine, should be creamy yellow. This is where it touches the ground.
- **Heavy for its size**; pick up a handful of watermelons, and if you find one
  that feels relatively heavy for its size, pick that one.
