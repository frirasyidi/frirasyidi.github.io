*The best wall I've seen so far!*

The entry is spectacular: we passed through a bridge made out of corals. Right after you passed it, you'll see that the wall is tall and full of corals from far down below up to 10m. Visibility is incredible that far in the blue you can see big fishes&mdash;I'm not sure, but perhaps they are Barracudas&mdash;schooling.
