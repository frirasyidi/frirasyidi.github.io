Localization is important. I've done a handful projects on localizing English sites to Indonesian and it's always challenging.

Below I've collected lists of UI terms in Indonesian. This is a growing list.

| English    | Bahasa Indonesia    | Note                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| English    | Bahasa Inggris      |                                          |
| Indonesian | Bahasa Indonesia    |                                          |
| home       | depan; alt. Beranda | I prefer to use *depan* to *beranda* since it's much easier to comprehend for Indonesian. Depan means "front" while beranda is "front porch". Depan is also easier and much easier to understand when translating homepage which translates into "halaman depan" (see: page/halaman) which is a very friendly and relatable term in Indonesia. See also: Front page/halaman muka. |
| page       | halaman             |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
|            |                     |                                          |
