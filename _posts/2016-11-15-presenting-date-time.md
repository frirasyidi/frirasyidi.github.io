## The problem in presenting date and time.

There are different date and time formats in use in different parts of the world and in different contexts. There are two major practical problems:

* A date designation such as 5/6/98 is ambiguous: which of the first two numbers is the month and which is the day? It is interpreted as the 5th of June, 1998, in most countries. However, in the United States it is generally interpreted as the 6th of May, 1998. This has caused a lot of confusion.
* Date designations that do not explicitly specify the century can cause serious problems in the 21st century. This "millennium problem" or "year 2000 problem" or "Y2K" is definitely not over yet. On the contrary, now that we are in the 21st century, we face the problem in everyday life.
