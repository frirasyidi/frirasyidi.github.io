For the past year, I've been working in HappyFresh&mdash;a groceries delivery startup. Last week, I was trusted by my friends to pick the best fruits but I have no idea how to do it.

This post is my attempt to catalogue the key to get the best fruits. Keep in mind that this would be a growing list.

Sorted alphabetically:

## Apple

* **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no bruising, soft spots or cracks.
* **Firm**; avoid taking apples that are soft, discolored, or easily indented when lightly pressed.
* **Red or yellowish color**; most of the time, get the most red you can find. Find green and yellow for Granny Smith and Golden delicious apples.
* **Pleasant aroma**; smell the apple. A good and fresh apple should have a pleasant aroma.

## Melon

* **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no bruising, soft spots or cracks.
* **Smell sweet**; a good melons should smell sweet and fragrant on the part where the vine is attached.
* **Dull skin**; a ripe melon has shiny skins with a green or white colors. Always choose the yellowish dull colored melons.
* **Heavy for its size**; pick up a handful of melons, and if you find one that feels relatively heavy for it's size, pick that one.

## Watermelon

* **No defects**; inspect its looks. There should be no bruising, soft spots or cracks.
* **Sounds hollow**; tap the watermelon. If it sounds hollow, that means your watermelon is ripe, watery, and sweet.
* **Yellowish bottom**; the bottom part of your watermelon, the opposite part from the vine, should be creamy yellow. This is where it touches the ground.
* **Heavy for its size**; pick up a handful of watermelons, and if you find one that feels relatively heavy for it's size, pick that one.
